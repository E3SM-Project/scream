MPAS-Seaice idealized test cases
================================

To set up and run these test cases requires the following environment variables to be set:
MPAS_TOOLS_DIR: The location of MPAS-Tools with the mesh conversion tools built
MPAS_SEAICE_TESTCASES_RUN_COMMAND (optional): The command to run MPAS-Seaice with (e.g. "mpirun -np 1"). The test cases have not been tested with multiple processors and generally do not run for long enough to necessitate parallel runs. If not set then the seaice_model executable is run directly.

To run a test case simply run the run_testcase.py script.

Several python packages are also necessary:
 - netCDF4
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - f90nml
 - scipy
 - shapely

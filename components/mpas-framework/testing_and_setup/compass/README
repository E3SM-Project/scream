This directory provides a simple test case workflow definition capability. It
is intended to house a minimal number of files which can describe the steps to
setup and configure a test case.

It provides four utility python scripts:
    * clean_testcase.py
    * list_testcases.py
    * setup_testcase.py
    * manage_regression_suite.py

and two configuration file templates:
    * general.config.test
    * general.config.ocean

Each of the python scripts can be run with a -h argument only to get usage information.

Additionally, each core has a directory at the top level (e.g. ocean for the
ocean test cases). There is also a templates directory where a core can place
template files that are intended to be available for it's test cases.

An example test case is placed in ocean/baroclinic_channel/10km
An example template is placed in templates/ocean/global_stats.xml

Test cases are described by XML files. Each test case can have an arbitrary
number of XML files that configure the steps for setting up the test case.

The various XML files that can be used with this test case infrastructure are
described in the README files contained in the doc directory.
 - doc/README.config: Describes configuration of a specific step (called a
                      case) in a test case.
 - doc/README.driver_script: Describes configuration of a script to drive an
                             entire test case (multiple steps / cases)
 - doc/README.template: Describes configuration of a template which can be
                        applied to multiple config files.
 - doc/README.regression_suite: Describes configuration of a regression suite,
                                which is a group of test cases.
 - doc/README.run_config: Defines how to take a <model_run> step, and convert
                          it into running the model executable in a specific environment.

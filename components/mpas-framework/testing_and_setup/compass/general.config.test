# This file is the test core's configuration file. It is specific to the test
# core, and a specific machine. Each machine will configure this file
# differently, but it can be used to point on version of the testing
# infrastructure at a different version of the model.

# The namelists section describes required namelist templates that are used to
# generate specific namelist files. In the test core, there is only a 'forward'
# mode template, which generally points to the namelist.test generated in
# default_inputs after a successful build of the model.

# default_inputs after a successful build of the model.

This directory creates a 1-8 km variable resolution mesh for the Thwaites glacier.
The variable resolution mesh is generated using JIGSAW-GEO:
https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-geo-matlab
JIGSAW-GEO needs to be run manually from Matlab before running the rest of this case.
(It may be possible to include that step in the set up process, but it seems like
more trouble than it is worth for now.)

To create the mesh, run the .m script in the subdirectory 'jigsaw',
and then copy or link the resulting file into this directory.

After this is complete, set up and run the test case as normal.

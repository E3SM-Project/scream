 *  Emulating c++1z features
 *
 *  This file contains some features that belongs to the std namespace,
 *  and that are likely (if not already scheduled) to be in future standards.
 *  However, we have limited access to c++1z standard on target platforms,
 *  so we can only rely on c++11 features. Everything else that we may need,
 *  we try to emulate here.

To set up a suite of runs:

1. Run standard compass set up script to create an instance of the test case, e.g.:
./setup_testcase.py -f general.config.landice.mjh -n 37 --work_dir /net/scratch1/mhoffman/mpas-testing/

2. Run the set up script that is created from the work_dir location, e.g.:
cd /net/scratch1/mhoffman/mpas-testing/landice/Thwaites_variability/standard_resolution/standard_configuration
./setup_thwaites_testcase.py

Steps 1 and 2 are done primarily to keep this under version control, including the creation of the namelist and streams files.

3. To generate and run a suite of simulations within variability parameter space, use the script setup_many_runs.sh
which is symlinked into your work_dir location.  Be sure to manually adjust the variables at the top!

4. After runs complete (or during their execution), use the compare_variability_runs.py script to plot results.




To set up the fixed resolution tests:

* symlink the desired AIS input dataset into this directory.  Probably one or both of:
/usr/projects/climate/mhoffman/AIS_IC_data/ais14to4/ais14to4km.20160713.nc
/usr/projects/climate/mhoffman/AIS_IC_data/ais30to1/ais30to1.20160713.nc
You need to set this line uniform_resolution/resolution_testing_configuration/config_setup_experiments.xml to the version you want to use:
 <add_link source_path="script_configuration_dir" source="ais14to4km.20160713.nc" dest="ais_input_data.nc"/>
* setup test case:
   38: -o landice -c Thwaites_variability -r uniform_resolution -t resolution_testing_configuration
* run the script in the workdir: ./setup_test.py
* to change the resolution, copy the desired resolution over the top of namelist.input in uniform_resolution/resolution_testing_configuration/  (note re-running things will clobber a previous setup, so you should rename that dir accordingly

    !1. All the prec* variables have the units of m/s in the model but they are converted to mm/s when
    !they are assigned to the respective cam_out members in components/eam/src/cpl/atm_import_export.F90

    !   'precc'  is Convective precipitation rate (liq + ice)
    !   'precsc' is Convective snow rate (water equivalent)

    !   'precl'  is Large-scale (stable) precipitation rate (liq + ice)
    !   'precsl' is Large-scale (stable) snow rate (water equivalent)

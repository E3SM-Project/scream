This document describes the format of a regression_suite file, which is used to
define a regression suite, which envolves a set of tests that should be run.

A regression_suite file contains information describing a set of tests that
should be setup / run as part of a regression test suite.

Below, you will see text describing the various XML tags available in a regression_suite
file. Each will describe the tag itself, any attributes the tag can have, and
what children can be placed below the tag.

<regression_suite> - This is the overarching parent tag in a regression_suite
                     file. It defines the suite that will be setup
    - Attributes:
        * name: This attribute defines the name of the regression suite. A
                script will be generated named <name>.py that will run the entire
                  regression suite in the location the regression suite is setup (i.e.
                  work_dir)
    - Children:
        * <test>

<test> - This tag defines a test that will be included as part of the regression suite.
    - Attributes:
        * name: This attribute defines the name of the test as part of this
                regression suite. NOTE: This name is only used in this
                regression suite, so multiple suites can name the same test in
                different ways.
        * core: This attribute defines the core that would be passed to
                setup_testcases.py to setup this test.
        * configuration: This attribute defines the configuration that would be passed to
                setup_testcases.py to setup this test.
        * resolution: This attribute defines the resolution that would be passed to
                setup_testcases.py to setup this test.
    - Children:
        * <script>

<script> - This tag defines a script that will be run to perform the specified test.
    - Attributes:
        * name: This attribute defines the name of the script that will be run
                to perform the specified test. Typically this is a driver script.

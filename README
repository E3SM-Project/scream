====================
SCREAM Documentation
====================

This plain-text README is meta-documentation for you, the reader, if you're
interested in contributing to our nascent documentation effort.

We are trying out MkDocs (https://mkdocs.org), a simple static website generator
for people who are tired of trying to get Sphinx to work properly. Our goal is
to use MkDocs to build two important pieces of documentation for SCREAM:

1. A User Guide, which explains to climate scientists how to build SCREAM and
   configure and run cases of interest.
2. A Developer Guide, which serves as the primary resource for developers who
   contribute to SCREAM.

You can read all you want about MkDocs at the above link, but here are the
essentials:

* In the MkDocs universe, all documentation is written using Markdown and a set
  of nifty configurable extensions (including Latex-style math!).
* Documentation files are organized into folders corresponding to the User
  Guide (user/), the Developer Guide (dev/), and common elements (common/). In
  principle, we can make as deep a hierarchy as we want (and people with
  advanced degrees love to go nuts with deep hierachies!), but let's start
  simple.
* MkDocs is configured using settings in mkdocs.yml, which lives in SCREAM's
  top-level source directory.
* The only thing you'll probably have to change in mkdocs.yml is the nav
  section, near the top of the file. This section contains three basic elements:
  * The SCREAM documentation home page
  * A link to the User Guide and its sections
  * A link to the Developer Guide and its sections

/*
 *   An enum to tag fields dimensions
 *
 *   Field tags are meant to be used to determine what each dimension
 *   in a field refers to, and help distinguish fields.
 *   For instance, say there are two classes A and B, storing a field
 *   called 'tracers', but they expect the layout to be different.
 *   Namely, A expects to index the field as (element, dim, gauss point, gauss point),
 *   while B expects to index it as (element, gauss point, gauss point, dim).
 *   A check on the field name and rank is not enough to establish
 *   that the two fields are not the same. If the number of dimensions
 *   is equal to the number of points, even a check on the extents
 *   would not distinguish the two. At this point, using a tag for each
 *   dimension is the only way to distiguish the two.
 *   
 *   This can also be used (by the driver, or by the atm processes) to
 *   determine whether an input/output field has the same layout in the
 *   field repository as in the atm process, and therefore whether it
 *   needs 'remapping' or not (here 'remapping' is in the programming
 *   sense, not in the mathematical (e.g. eulerian-lagrangian) sense).

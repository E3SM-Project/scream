This directory contains namelist.input files for several resolutions of the MISMIP+ experiments
(8000 m, 4000 m, 2000 m, 1000 m and 500 m).  The resolution set up in the test directory is determined
by the namelist.input file.  The default resolution is 2000 m.  (The default namelist.input is 
identical to namelist.input.2000m, and the default config_setup_experiment.xml will set up the 
experiment in a directory called '2000m'.)

If you would like to run at a different resolution, you can do the following:

(1) Copy your preferred namelist.input.* file to namelist.input, e.g.:

    > cp namelist.input.1000m namelist.input

    If there is no such file at your preferred resolution, see the comments in namelist.input
    for guidance on making a new one.

(2) In config_setup_experiment.xml, edit the case name.  E.g., change this line:

    <config case="2000m">

    to this:

    <config case="1000m">

(3) Go to the testcase setup directory and set up the case in the usual way, e.g.:

    > cd my_mpas_directory/MPAS-Core/test_cases/ocean
    > ./list_testcases.py [Say the test case you just created is #26]
    > ./setup_testcase.py -o landice -n 26 -f general.config.landice --work_dir /full_path_to_my_test_dir

Note: Resolutions coarser than 2 km are unlikely to give physically accurate results, but can be useful
for testing and debugging.  Resolutions of 1 km or higher are expected to be accurate, but can take
a long time to spin up.
